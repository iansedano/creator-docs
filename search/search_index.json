In short, we want our courses to build on mixing the following four concepts: Read Watch Code Reflect Let's talk in more detail how you can implement these four concepts. Read \u00b6 Written course material gives students a structured and searchable way to gain knowledge. While for many learners it may not be the most engaging way to learn, it serves its purpose in introducing concepts and making it easy to go back to when needing to fill memory gaps. We have guidelines for technical writing that you should follow when creating the written materials for your course. In short: be clear and structured, and have fun. Watch \u00b6 Walkthrough: Show every new concept at least once before students are meant to complete it by themselves. Screencast walkthroughs are great for this exposure. Having seen the challenge completed once makes it much easier for students to learn. Code \u00b6 Labs: While understanding is crucial, it isn't enough for learning something new. In our courses, we use short programming exercises called \"labs\" for practice. Training the learned concepts helps to understand them better, as well as giving the needed repetition to train the learner's muscle-memory. Project-Oriented: Students learn best through building projects. Our brains only remember new concepts when there's a compelling reason to do so. Build well-designed projects gives students both the justification on why to learn something new, as well as satisfaction on completing it. This is why we aim to build our courses project-oriented. Capstone Project: The final capstone project of a course allows students to employ their creativity and their own interests. A good capstone project is framed well and allows students to bring together all the knowledge they gained throughout the course. At the same time it avoids hand-holding students through it, and gives them enough freedom to customize it towards their personal interests. We want to send our students off with a great project to put on their portfolio, as well as with the tools and mindset that they are able to create and accomplish their ideas by themselves. Reflect \u00b6 Reflection is essential for retention of learned content, which is why it helps students when you push them to look back and synthesize their new knowledge. Quiz Checkpoints: Interlaced with the written and video course content, students encounter quizzes that serve as checkpoints for themselves. Answering quiz questions forces them to synthesize the content they previously passively consumed. It also allows them to understand whether they got a grip on the previous section's content, or whether they will have to study it some more. Writing Prompts: To encourage students to further reflect on their learning process, you can include writing prompts (e.g. \"Journal\" resources, or open-ended quiz questions ). How To Duplicate a Resource \u00b6 Starting with our copied skeleton course resource, the easiest may be to duplicate a resource and then replace the content. This is the recommended way of starting to build your course, since it keeps important settings intact. The following video shows you how to duplicate an existing resource in our platform: How to Duplicate a Section From Another Course \u00b6 Note: You will probably not need to do this, but since it has come up, here are the steps. You can copy sections from other courses also in your role as a Teacher . To do so, click on the cogwheel-symbol on the top right of your course page, then on Import : Next, select the course you want to import from, and then select the Sections/Resources you need: Keep clicking through the prompts until you're finished, and the imported resources will be merged with the resources you already have in your course in the respective sections.","title":"Course Creation Basics"},{"location":"00-basics/#course-creation-basics","text":"This page introduces you to the basic ideas around creating courses for CodingNomads.

Sections are grouped together using Module Tags Section : Also sometimes called \"Section Topics\" or even just \"Topics\" in Moodle \ud83d\ude44. These are the collapsible sections and used for high-level structuring of the content Chapter : You create chapters by sub-dividing sections using Section Dividers Lesson : Each activity or resource that you create in your course (e.g. a Page or a Quiz) can be referred to as a \"lesson\". This is the smallest unit that will be visible in the course overview In this diagram you saw a visual description of the different elements as they appear on our platform. Structure \u00b6 Follow the 3-step-teaching principle: Many have recommended to use this structure, and we do too. Intro: Tell your students what information you will give them Main: Give them that info Recap: Tell them what information they just got Attempt to follow these three simple steps even for short sections. Our brain processes new information in small chunks, and it needs a proper introduction and recap to fully absorb new topics. Assume that your students are new to everything you're teaching them. Following the outlined steps above helps them with remembering the content you're teaching. It makes learning more fun and effective for your students. Sum up paragraphs: Try to sum up the paragraph's entire content in the first sentence. You can think of it as a mini-intro and mini-conclusion all in one piece. The body of the paragraph that follows explains the concept in more detail and gives readers a chance to linger and absorb the information. Use parallel structure for lists and headings: Clarity is important for technical writing. Always use parallel structure when creating list items as well as headings. Parallel structure means to use the same sentence structure for each new piece of information. E.g. I wrote all the headings on this page as nouns. Each paragraph that introduces new information begins with a verb and attempts to convey the main idea of that paragraph. Parallel structure is very powerful in making your content look well structured, it can help yourself to plan out a topic clearly, and it helps your students to easier absorb the information. Use a flat TOC structure: Aim on using main headings and one additional level of sub-headings, not more. To correctly integrate with our platform, that means using <h3> headings as your main headings, and <h4> as sub-headings. Use text blocks: Each paragraph should have some visible body to it. If a text contains multiple paragraphs that consist of only one or two sentences the text may at first sight appear less professional. No need to be too strict about this, but something to keep in mind. On the other hand, also avoid making your paragraphs too blocky. Use visual aids: Using graphs, code blocks, or also fun memes and images can help to ligthen the information load on your students. Technical content can get overwhelming. You're encouraged to loosen it up and give a break to your readers' eyes by introducing visual aids. If a text section seems long and dry to yourself, it will also seems so to your students. Pop in some images to change the visual pace. Use list and paragraph headlines: Bolded words or short sentences at the beginning of a list item or a paragraph help to introduce a topic. They guide your students' eyes and assist in easier absorbing relevant information. Always try to keep them in parallel structure. Formatting \u00b6 Be consistent: Just like in programming, there are many correct ways of formatting your content. Please adhere to this style guide to allow consistency across all CodingNomads courses. And, most importantly, be consistent within your own course materials. Use bolding for new terms: Bolding should be used to introduce new terms and highlight key phrases (e.g. \"In this section, you'll learn about iteration \") Use emphasis to put focus on a word: Emphasis should be used to, well, put emphasis on a word or part of a sentence (e.g. \"There is so much to learn\") Use \"you\" instead of \"we\": Talking directly to your student makes them feel personally addressed and more engaged. (e.g. \"The project you'll be working with...\") Tone \u00b6 Be friendly, supportive, and professional: Our students should feel that they are chatting with a knowledgeable and encouraging friend who is invested in their progress and also happens to be an expert on the subject matter. Choose your words wisely: Avoid using words such as \"easy\", \"straightforward\", \"obvious\" etc. Your students are new to this topic, and what might seem easy to you, won't necessarily be easy for them. To avoid alienating students, rather use words such as \"user-friendly\". Show your personality as an author: No one likes to read or watch a sterile tutorial when learning something new and challenging. Add your personal touches--be it xkcd comics, memes, or dad jokes. Of course only if that's how you roll. Don't force it, but feel free to make it fun both for yourself while writing and recording, as well as for your students when going through the course. Most of all, allow yourself to be authentic instead of sterile. Show the instructor is also a mere mortal: It helps students to know that you also make mistakes, and that also for you some concepts were daunting at first or difficult to grasp. Show that you're supportive: Programming topics are tough and often confusing for newcomers. It can easily feel overwhelming, even after making some progress, when the door opens up wider and ever more information starts flooding in. Try to help your students by giving them a stable ground to stand on. Be supportive and encourage them to keep learning. Feel free to have some fun! We want our students to enjoy our courses as much as possible and laugh as often as possible! :) Images \u00b6 Make sure to only use image material that is copyright-free.

It is simple to read and write, introduces consistency through limiting options, and makes the content easy to re-use in other contexts. Write in Markdown rather than using a text editing program such as MS Word or Google Docs. It is also better to use Markdown than directly creating your content inside our learning platform. The latter can sometimes be a drag due to the content box window sizing and other platform-related small annoyances. It might also make the content too site-specific and difficult to transition elsewhere. We've made this mistake before, and would prefer to avoid accruing more technical debt. Note: If you still want to use the platform-included WYSIWYG editor (called \"Atto\"), please check out how to choose your text editor and make sure to thoroughly read over and stick with our Style Guide . Here is a screencast that explains how to add your Markdown content to a resource in our platform: Headings \u00b6 As a small deviation from keeping your content as platform-agnostic as possible, you should use lower-level headings as your page's main headings: Main Headings: Use <h3> (or ### in Markdown) as your page content's main heading. Sub-Headings: Use <h4> (or #### in Markdown) as your page content's sub-headings. The course content will be integrated in our platform, and higher-level headings are reserved for course and page headings, which need to be entered in a different entry form. Links \u00b6 We want to make sure that all links open up in a new tab when clicked, to avoid students from accidentally navigating away from the course. Markdown syntax doesn't have an equivalent to HTML's target=\"_blank\" which would allow to open links in new tabs. Therefore, please use real HTML for creating links in your Markdown docs: This is <a href=\"http://your.url\" target=\"_blank\">a link</a> Note: You can use this script to replace all normal Markdown links with HTML links that open up in new tabs. If you remember to use this script, you can write Markdown links as you're used to, and run the script before uploading your content to our platform. This may save you some editing time. Code And Code Blocks \u00b6 Code snippets wrapped in single backticks as well as code blocks with triple-backticks are correctly rendered by the platform's Markdown engine. Example Markdown Rendering \u00b6 When entering your content in Markdown, it will look like that during input: The above Markdown text will correctly render in our platform like so: Text Editor Choice \u00b6 You can change your default text editor in your user profile's cogwheel drop-down Editor Preferences .

You can read about logistics regarding hosting and how to include them into your course, as well as some examples of how expected lab challenges could look like. Lab Content \u00b6 Labs are the training exercises for your students. They are the \"katas\" of a programmer and should help your students to train their skills by pushing them to type and think and type some more. Repetition is an important part of learning, and while your main focus should be on getting students to work on interesting projects, some coding concepts simply require plain old training. Breaking concepts up into small parts that can be individually trained also helps students to keep on top of the large amount of new information they need to absorb. Form \u00b6 To make it easy for students to start coding, you should provide them with files that include instructions so that they only need to open the file their preferred text editor and start coding. Example \u00b6 An example file for our beginner Python course looks e.g. like so: 01_06_hello5.py ''' Write the necessary code to display \"Hello World!\" 5 times. ''' The file contains the instructions for the lab's task as a python multi-line comment. Right underneath the comment the student can write and execute their code: 01_06_hello5.py ''' Write the necessary code to display \"Hello World!\" 5 times. ''' print(\"Hello World! \" * 5) After finishing the task, they can push it back up to their GitHub repo and thus keep the instructions and the code side-by-side. This makes it easy for their mentor to give them feedback on the lab. Hosting And Accessing Labs \u00b6 GitHub Hosted: We host labs on GitHub, one repository per course. Our lab repos should look similar to this course example and link to a call for signing up for the course in their README file. Students Download Or Clone Labs : Students either download the .zip for the repo from GitHub, or clone the repo at the beginning of taking the course. Generally, we want to encourage students to use version control and open-source right from the start. However, for beginner courses we opt for students to download a .zip file rather than making them jump through the hoops of using Git and GitHub. Beginner Course : Set up a URL Resource in your course that links to a \"Download ZIP\" URL of your course's GitHub repo. Advanced Course : You can opt to add a resource that explains students quickly how to clone your labs repo. We can assume that advanced students are already familiar with using version control. Pro's and Con's for Downloading vs. Cloning the labs: Download: No sync for updates we do Clone: requires some pre-existing Git knowledge Ordering Labs \u00b6 Files and file structures can easily get out of control and there are always 100 valid ways of setting up a repository. For uniformity's sake, we ask you to stick to the following setup. However, we are open for suggestions on how to improve the structure. Use Logical Folder Structure \u00b6 When creating your labs it is best to follow a folder structure that mirrors the section structure of your course. Each course section should have some associated labs. A logical folder structure will help your students in their learning progress. Use Consistent Numbering \u00b6 Use double-double-digit numbering for individual labs. This helps to keeps them in the order you intend students to tackle them. Here's a link to a script that helps with renaming . It's likely that you'll need to rename your labs in the process of creating your course.

Having a good microphone makes up for most of that, but there are also a couple of other things to consider. Read about how to improve your hardware setup for audio recording in this section. Microphone \u00b6 If you are serious about creating quality screencasts, a good microphone is essential. Please contact us if you are building a course but you don't have a quality microphone equipment, since we may be able to support you in purchasing one. Recommendation: \"Audio Technica ATR 2100 USB\" (or \"Samson Q2U\" in Europe). This is a low-price but high-quality microphone that operates over USB. It is small and simple to handle, yet dramatically increases the audio quality as compared to your built-in computer mic. Microphone Adjustments \u00b6 Distance: Aim for 2-20cm (1-8 inches) between your mouth and the microphone. Direction: Aim to speak directly into the mic, not off to the side. Gain: Turn up your gain, but avoid it going too high. Additional Equipment \u00b6 Mic Arm: Sinc you will want to have your computer in front of you for coding, a mic arm can help to place the mic where you need it for a good recording outcome. Pop-Filter: Plosives, such as \"p\", \"t\", \"k\", can come out surprisingly loud and disturbing in a spoken audio recording. A pop filter can help to reduce these pop sounds. Headphones: In case that you like to hear your voice during the recording, a pair of headphones will be necessary. Use in-ear headphones to avoid any sound they produce from leaking into your recording. Audio Foam: Using audio foam can reduce room echo. If you have a small room with fabric, such as a walk-in closet, that can also work as an uncomplicated alternative. T-Shirt: No, this is not about getting dressed! Putting a T-Shirt under your laptop while recording can significantly reduce the clicking noise that your computer keys make. Software \u00b6 Most of your videos will be screen recordings . The important part to remember is that we want you to record both your video as well as audio in the highest resolution that makes sense. Large files are not a problem, and having a high video and audio quality allows for more precise editing (e.g. code zooms when necessary) without compromising the viewing experience. Below is a list of software solutions that help you with recording your screen while retaining video quality as well as your personal sanity: QuickTime Player (MacOS): Comes with the OS and is a simple way to get started . Price : Free iShowUInstant (MacOS): Allows to record specific windows and even set the size of a recording screen. Easy to start/pause/stop recordings. Low-cost option that makes already improves your screen recording experience. (I, Martin, use this one. Happy to answer questions about it) Price : $24 OBS Studio (MacOs, Windows, Linux): Free and Open-Source software for video recording and live streaming. Check out these tutorials for Windows or for Linux Price : Free Screen Flow (MacOs): Professional screen recording software with a higher price tag and more features. Price : $129 Camtasia (MacOS, Windows): The biggest and baddest (but in a good way). Includes a full-featured and easy-to-use editing studio as well. Haven't used it myself, but heard good things about it. Probably overkill, though, unless you're really into that. Price : \u20ac269.05 Additional Software KeyCastr (MacOs): you can show key presses on screen, which helps viewers if you're using any keyboard shortcuts. The program allows you to display all key presses or only command keys, and is easy to toggle on and off. Mousepose (MacOs): allows to highlight your cursor to better show clicks and cursor movements on your recording. Alternatively, you can increase your cursor size through your operating system\u2019s accessibility settings. Recording \u00b6 Video Length \u00b6 3-5 minutes: Keeping your videos short helps both you and your students to stay on track. Aim for 3-5 minutes per video, and definitely stay below 10 minutes. If you are explaining a complex concept that requires more time, split it up in logical chunks that are each below 10 minutes. Keeping our students engaged is paramount, so we want to give them the sense of achievement and completion when finishing a section as often as possible. Our brains are also much better at processing small chunks of information, and it's easier for students to go back and revisit a topic if the videos are on-point, clear, and easy to digest. Shorter videos: You can also create shorter videos, e.g. to introduce a section in the course. Such videos can be only 1 minute long, yet help students to prepare for an upcoming new topic. Screen Resolution And Framerate \u00b6 Always record in a 16:9 ratio with a framerate of 60 FPS . Don't go below 30 FPS since cursor movements start looking jumpy and are then difficult to follow. To assure the right screen ratio, either set your screen resolution to 16:9 and record fullscreen, or create a defined 16:9 area on your screen and record only that section. Screen recording software can greatly help with both aspects. Fullscreen-Recording : Your screen needs to be set to a 16:9 resolution (e.g. 720p HiDPI (= 1440p real resolution), 1080p or 720p). If your computer doesn't support a 16:9 screen resolution, there are a few hacks you can attempt: External Monitor : If you have access to an external monitor with the right aspect ratio, this can be a great way to go. It also allows you to use your laptop for notes etc. while recording. Hidden Display Options : On some MacBook models and MacOS versions, you can access additional resolutions with a small \"trick\". In your display preferences, hold \"option\" when clicking on \"Scaled\" to see previously hidden resolutions: SwitchResX : In case the above doesn't work for you, SwitchResX is a tool that allows setting user-defined screen resolutions on MacOS. Price : $14 Clarity And Focus \u00b6 Use a clean and focused design for your desktop, dock, status bar, etc. to: avoid dating your assets (remove clocks, assets that may change in future OS versions etc.) avoid distractions to increase students' focus On MacOS, you can remove a lot of the items in your status bar via the System Preferences. A reduced version can look like below: Remove unused items from your doc and keep it focused on dev tools that you are using, e.g.: Additional Tips \u00b6 Increase all font sizes : in your IDE , your browser , and your terminal . Make it big, bigger than you'd think. It's always better to focus on small parts of code and make it easy to read and understand. Increase your cursor size : This makes it easier to orient for your students. In MacOS you can increase the cursor size in Accessibility Settings. General Info \u00b6 Which Sections Should Have a Video? \u00b6 Every Section should have at least one video. Screencasts offer students a different way to approach the material. They get exposure to a topic that is new for them, and the proof that, and how, it can be done. This makes a big difference in preparing the mind to accept new information. I like it if every new concept that's introduced is shown at least once by the instructor. (Student Quote) Video Screencasts are our online way of walking students through a concept and giving them the high-level understanding and confidence that it can be done. Course Intro & Goodbye Video \u00b6 Every course should have an intro video as well as a goodbye video. Make your students feel welcome and cared for. Introduce yourself as well as your course in the introduction video, and congratulate your students and point them to next steps in your goodbye video. Feel free to record yourself speaking. If you do so, remember to keep your background neutral. These videos can be very short (~1 min). Section Intro Videos \u00b6 Optionally you can create short section introduction videos (~1 min) that audio-visually explain what topics will be addressed in the upcoming course part. For these videos, you can use Google Sheets or PowerPoint to create simple and minimal slides that address the main points the section will be talking about. Screencasts, Slides, Or Face Recording? \u00b6 Most videos should be screencasts . You want to show your students how you code and solve challenges, and get them familiar and comfortable looking at a screen with code. Screencasts with voice narration are therefore the main type of videos you should create for your course. That said, you can always loosen it up and increase retention and enjoyment for your students. You can use slides to introduce new topics and to create recaps at the end of a section. In the intro and goodbye videos, and also sometimes in between, if you feel comfortable with that, you can record yourself talking directly to your students, giving them encouragement. Slides \u00b6 When using slides for any of your videos please use our slides template . Make a copy of the template and create your slides from it. We suggest doing this in order to keep the style consistent across multiple courses. Stick with this basic design . It'll help your students to focus on the essential information. Note : If you are using KeyNote on MacOS, you can download a corresponding Keynote theme here . Please install the suggested fonts locally: Slide Fonts \u00b6 Barlow condensed (titles) Source Sans Pro (text) Roboto Mono (code) You can download them all from here . Video Creation Tips \u00b6 Below are a selection of tips and tricks to keep in mind to amp up your video creation game and assure high-quality, educational screencasts. Tips For Better Quality Screencasts \u00b6 Use A Stable Table : Especially if you use your computer camera to record yourself talking, it is necessary that the setup is stable and doesn't wobble around. Zen Screen : To help students focus and make you look more professional, avoid any screen clutter. You don't want distracting wallpapers or a cluttered Desktop, too many apps in your Dock, notifications to show up during recording (set the mode to \"Do not disturb\") etc. Cultivating a zen screen for your video recordings also makes inconsistencies between different videos less likely. Timeless Videos : Avoid showing aspects of your OS that are highly dateable. That includes e.g. the MacOS dock, Windows Start Menu etc., as well as close buttons and of course the clock with date and time. The easiest way to avoid showing dateable items, is to use the full-screen mode of your text editor. If you need to show your desktop, set your clock to analogue or remove it entirely. Relaxed Code : Give your viewers some time to see the code you just typed. Pausing for a moment helps students to absorb, type, or pause the video in the right spot without getting stressed. It helps to see the code for a few seconds before moving on. Content-Focus : Minimize intro times and blabbering and talk about your the content right away. Students are here to learn effectively. Occasionaly jokes and break-out moments are encouraged and really lighten the load, but make sure that overall your videos are effective and content-focused. Large Fonts : Use a large font in your editor. Bump up the font size. Usually, you will focus only on a small section of code at a time. Showing that specific section in a large font is absolutely preferrable to having a cluttered screen with lots of code in a small font. Crisp Text : Avoid blurry text. This ties in with using a high resolution that allows you to zoom into specific sections of your code when editing the video. High-Contrast Color Schemes : We want our videos to be as accessible as possible. Use high-contrast color schemes in your editor to make sure the code is as legible as possible. Avoid \"Smart Quotes\" : Don't use unicode \"smart quotes\", they cause syntax errors. Instead make sure that you use plain quotes in your code examples, also when creating them on slide decks. Keep Your Errors : A tutorial teaches two things: the topic of the tutorial, as well as how to approach solving problems. If it isn't too distracting, keep the mistakes and syntax errors you make in where it makes sense and use them as an opportunity to teach your thought process for debugging. Your viewers will appreciate this as a learning opportunity. Recap Your Videos : Remember the 3-step teaching process and make sure that you intro and recap the topics of your screencasts. Avoid Swearing : Don't swear. Tips That Allow Viewers To Follow-Along Easier \u00b6 Orientation : Avoid switch tabs, windows, and applications too quickly. State clearly where you are and what you are doing. Context is very important to help absorb new information. Point To Your Code : Help your viewers to keep track of what you are talking about by circling the code you want to point to with your cursor. You can enlarge the cursor in your OS's accessibility settings. Avoid Shortcuts : Use your cursor and menus to create new files etc. Keyboard shortcuts are confusing when you can't see what has been clicked. If you must use keyboard shortcuts, limit it to common ones and use software to display the shortcut on screen . Preferrably you do everything on screen so that your viewers can follow along. Scroll For Navigation : Show your scrolling when navigating within a file. Avoid jumping around or editing out the scrolling. This, again, makes it easier for viewers follow along and stay on track with your explanations. Avoid (Background) Noise : Find a quiet spot for your recording. Audio quality is paramount for screen recordings. Avoid construction outside, pets, ceiling fans, creaky floors and chairs, as well as human-made distracting noises, such as coughing, mouth noises, etc. Avoid Filler Words : Attempt to cut down on using filler words, such as (ahem, uhm, like, so, you know, etc.) Some can be edited-out, but if you use them frequently, it is a ginormous effort to do so. Avoiding to use filler words makes you appear much more competent and makes your content easier to follow. Avoid Visual Distractions : If you are recording yourself speaking, use a neutral background that isn't distracting for your viewers. Record Small Chunks : Recording smaller chunks will keep your quality high. When recording too much in one take, you might get tired and inattentive without noticing it. Tutoring Instead Of Presenting : Imagine that you are speaking to only one person. Students should feel like they are in a mentor-student relationship, rather than sitting in a room full of people in an auditorium or at a conference. Tips For Easier Editing \u00b6 Silence While Typing : If you are typing a longer section of code that doesn't need explanation on-the-go, avoid talking while typing. The silence makes it easy to edit out or speed up when editing. Title Your Files : Use double-digit numbering in combination with the screencast topic's title for naming your video files, e.g.: 01_variables.mov . Clarify Mistakes During Recording : When you realize that an explanation isn't working well or when you make a mistake you want to correct, first stop and mention that you'll redo this section. Then pause for a few seconds, undo what you did to get back to the start, pause again, and then start again . This helps to identify necessary edits and makes it easier to get good cuts. Add Editing Notes : Add a README file with notes for editing to your recorded screencasts. This document should mention: At what timestamp in which video are mistakes --to quicker find and cut them when editing When there should be a screen overlay (e.g. when accidentally mis-naming something while talking) and what should be on the screen overlay Upload : Upload the finished recordings to your dedicated shared folder to allow us to give you feedback and add necessary edits. Setting Up Video Time Instances \u00b6 Generally, our team will handle uploading the videos to our platform. If you are setting up the Video Time Instances yourself, make sure that the Responsive option is checked in the Embed option of the resource: Optionally, you can also check Autoplay for your videos.","title":"Creating Video Lessons"},{"location":"08-creating-videos/#creating-videos","text":"This document will guide you in how to create video lessons for your course.

Pop-Filter: Plosives, such as \"p\", \"t\", \"k\", can come out surprisingly loud and disturbing in a spoken audio recording. A pop filter can help to reduce these pop sounds. Headphones: In case that you like to hear your voice during the recording, a pair of headphones will be necessary. Use in-ear headphones to avoid any sound they produce from leaking into your recording. Audio Foam: Using audio foam can reduce room echo. If you have a small room with fabric, such as a walk-in closet, that can also work as an uncomplicated alternative. T-Shirt: No, this is not about getting dressed!

Aim for 3-5 minutes per video, and definitely stay below 10 minutes. If you are explaining a complex concept that requires more time, split it up in logical chunks that are each below 10 minutes. Keeping our students engaged is paramount, so we want to give them the sense of achievement and completion when finishing a section as often as possible. Our brains are also much better at processing small chunks of information, and it's easier for students to go back and revisit a topic if the videos are on-point, clear, and easy to digest.

To assure the right screen ratio, either set your screen resolution to 16:9 and record fullscreen, or create a defined 16:9 area on your screen and record only that section. Screen recording software can greatly help with both aspects. Fullscreen-Recording : Your screen needs to be set to a 16:9 resolution (e.g. 720p HiDPI (= 1440p real resolution), 1080p or 720p). If your computer doesn't support a 16:9 screen resolution, there are a few hacks you can attempt: External Monitor : If you have access to an external monitor with the right aspect ratio, this can be a great way to go. It also allows you to use your laptop for notes etc. while recording. Hidden Display Options : On some MacBook models and MacOS versions, you can access additional resolutions with a small \"trick\".

It will make most of the below information irrelevant to you. If you feel the need to style more individually, use Bootstrap classes . Bootstrap is included in the theme we're using. Only if neither fulfills your creative urges, read on for more fine-grained styling. Objective \u00b6 We want unified and adaptable styling across all courses on the whole site. Simple : Simple elements are favored over complex ones, because they are easier to set up and maintain Reusable : Allow Bootstrap to style your page, it's already included. Maintainable : Through consistent and simple structure, we can adapt styles centrally and avoid unnecessary effort and potential misalignment Therefore, we ask you to use simple HTML (e.g. through using the Markdown editor or the WYSIWYG editor) and customize the resulting HTML only minimally, with the following custom components: Custom Components \u00b6 Additional custom components you can use when creating and editing courses. Course Overview Page Additional Styling \u00b6 The following adaptations should be used to make the course overview page styled consistently and easier readable for students. Section Dividers \u00b6 To improve the visual flow in a course overview, you can add colored bars to further break up the content of a section. Section Dividers: These can be used to sub-divide a section into chapters and give it a relevant chapter heading. Create a \"Tag Resource\" on the platform, and add the following HTML code in the HTML editor: <h5 class=\"section-divider\">Relevant Chapter Heading</h5> Assignment Dividers: To indicate to students that the following materials require their own input, we use differently-colored dividers for a section that consist of instructions for mini-projects, quizzes, etc. You can create such a divider also using the \"Tag Resource\" and entering the following HTML code in the HTML editor: <h5 class=\"section-assignment\">Assignments</h5> Module Tags \u00b6 Module tags in the \"Summary\" of each section help students stay on track and visually bundle multiple sections logically together. Switch off blue and yellow tags for better visual grouping. Blue: <div class=\"d-flex flex-row-reverse\"> <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-info\"> Module 1 </span> </div> Yellow: <div class=\"d-flex flex-row-reverse\"> <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-warning\"> Module 2 </span> </div> Page Resources Individual Styling \u00b6 The following custom style elements should be considered when creating written documentation for your course content. Headings \u00b6 In the visual editor , use editor-provided headings levels: \"Heading (large)\" option creates <h3> element \"Heading (medium)\" option creates <h4> element \"Heading (small)\" option creates <h5> element Don't apply any editor styles to your headings. We want to avoid individually bolded headings. Avoiding individual styles allows us to increase heading size, font-weight, etc. centrally through SCSS. In Markdown , use the equivalent heading levels that the visual editor uses: Top-level heading: ### Second-level heading: #### Lowest-level heading: ##### Information And Alert Boxes \u00b6 Add disclaimers as alert alert-warning boxes when a new concept is mentioned but not yet deeply explained. You want to avoid students feeling like this (student quote): you know, I think my main issue is if I get to a page, and the way it is written implies I should already understand it, but it is completely new and unfamiliar. It has me worrying that it is obvious and I am the only one just not getting it. To avoid this frustration, use the Bootstrap alert box with a short note for criticial information and gotchas. E.g.: \"Just read over this for now, we'll dig deeper into it in a later section.\" <div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\"> <strong>Note:</strong> Take care to avoid xyz. </div> Use alert alert-info to include additional information e.g. on external resources that can lead students further onwards. E.g.: <div class=\"alert alert-info\" role=\"alert\"> <strong>Info:</strong> The first bug was a real bug! </div> The Bootstrap alert boxes also help to visually break up a long piece of content by highlighting an important section. Note: If you need to use multiple lines in your alert boxes, use <br> tags to create newlines (instead of using <p> tags). This results in nicer-looking alert boxes without additional spacing. Code Blocks \u00b6 Wrap code snippets into triple-backticks. This works both in Markdown as well as the visual editor: ``` print(\"your code here\") ``` Note: Syntax highlighting can sometimes be broken. This might be annoying and we hope to find a fix that'll solve it site-wise. In-line Code \u00b6 In Markdown , simply wrap your in-line code into single backticks . In the visual editor , there is no button for marking a section of text as inline code. Therefore, you will need to switch to the HTML editor and wrap in-line code snippets into <code>your_code()</code> tags. Embedded Resources \u00b6 For external videos that are not hosted on our vimeo account and e.g. external code playgrounds, use Bootstraps responsive embed class : <div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"> <iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"your_embed_url\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> Resources \u00b6 <div class=\"jumbotron resources\"> <h1>Resources</h1> </div> Paste the above HTML snippet into the HTML editor of your resource. Next, switch back to the WYSIWYG editor view and copy-paste your resource links into the body of the jumbotron. Style them as a bullet point list. Result: Quotes \u00b6 To highlight a section of your documentation as a quote, please use the Bootstrap-provided blockquote HTML : <blockquote class=\"blockquote text-right\"> <p class=\"mb-0\">[...] programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</p> <footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Abelson & Sussman in <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-7.html#%_chap_Temp_4\"><cite title=\"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</cite></a></footer> </blockquote> We are applying some custom CSS to it to make the quotes look like shown below: LaTeX \u00b6 If you want to use LaTeX to display formulas, the Marklar Markdown editor only supports LaTeX blocks : $$content$$ E.g. in order to display the following formula correctly rendered like so: You can write the following in the Marklar editor: $$\\text{EMA}_{t}=[V_t \\times (\\frac d {1+n})] + \\text{EMA}_y \\times [1 - \\frac d {1+n}]$$ For more information, refer to the LaTeX docs . Note: If you need to use a couple of single-line LaTeX in a row, e.g. for explaining the contents of a formula in more detail, we suggest to use a Bootstrap table for easier viewing, e.g.: <table class=\"table\"> <tbody> <tr> <th scope=\"row\">1</th> <td>$$\\text{EMA}_t=\\text{EMA today}$$</td> </tr> <tr> <th scope=\"row\">2</th> <td>$$p_t=\\text{price today}$$</td> </tr> <tr> <th scope=\"row\">3</th> <td>$$\\text{EMA}_y=\\text{EMA yesterday}$$</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Renders to: Video Slides \u00b6 To keep a unified style across our different courses, use the Slide Template (or corresponding Keynote Theme ). More information in the dedicated Video Slides section. Brand Colors \u00b6 In case you need to highlight something, focus on using the following colors that reflect the colors in the CodingNomads logo: primary: sea blue Hex value: #0071BD RGB code: rbg(0, 113, 189) HSV: hsv(204.13, 100%, 74.12%) secondary: sunset yellow (outermost) Hex value: #FBB03B RGB code: rbg(251, 176, 59) HSV: hsv(36.56, 76.49%, 98.43%) The general theme settings for our brand communication could reflect these two colors as primary (sea-blue) and secondary (sunset-yellow) brand colors. Fonts \u00b6 When creating any content that includes fonts outside of our learning platform (e.g. Video Slides), stick to using the following fonts: Barlow condensed (titles) Source Sans Pro (text) Roboto Mono (code) You can download them all from here .","title":"Style Guide"},{"location":"11-platform-style/#consistently-styled-course-content","text":"Note: Use Markdown to create your course content.
