In short, we want our courses to build on mixing the following four concepts: Read Watch Code Reflect Let's talk in more detail how you can implement these four concepts. Read \u00b6 Written course material gives students a structured and searchable way to gain knowledge. While for many learners it may not be the most engaging way to learn, it serves its purpose in introducing concepts and making it easy to go back to when needing to fill memory gaps. We have guidelines for technical writing that you should follow when creating the written materials for your course. In short: be clear and structured, and have fun. Watch \u00b6 Walkthrough: Show every new concept at least once before students are meant to complete it by themselves. Screencast walkthroughs are great for this exposure. Having seen the challenge completed once makes it much easier for students to learn. Code \u00b6 Project-Oriented: Students learn best through building projects. Our brains only remember new concepts when there's a compelling reason to do so. Build well-designed projects gives students both the justification on why to learn something new, as well as satisfaction on completing it. This is why we aim to build our courses project-oriented. Capstone Project: The final capstone project of a course allows students to employ their creativity and their own interests. A good capstone project is framed well and allows students to bring together all the knowledge they gained throughout the course. At the same time it avoids hand-holding students through it, and gives them enough freedom to customize it towards their personal interests. We want to send our students off with a great project to put on their portfolio, as well as with the tools and mindset that they are able to create and accomplish their ideas by themselves. Reflect \u00b6 Quiz Checkpoints: Interlaced with the written and video course content, students encounter quizzes that serve as checkpoints for themselves. Answering quiz questions forces them to synthesize the content they previously passively consumed. It also allows them to understand whether they got a grip on the previous section's content, or whether they will have to study it some more. How To Duplicate a Resource \u00b6 Starting with our copied skeleton course resource, you can often simply duplicate a resource and then replace the content. This is the recommended way of building your course, since it keeps important settings intact. The following video shows you how to duplicate an existing resource in our platform:","title":"Course Creation Basics"},{"location":"00-basics/#course-creation-basics","text":"This page introduces you to the basic ideas around creating courses for CodingNomads.

Intro: Tell your students what information you will give them Main: Give them that info Recap: Tell them what information they just got Attempt to follow these three simple steps even for short sections. Our brain processes new information in small chunks, and it needs a proper introduction and recap to fully absorb new topics. Assume that your students are new to everything you're teaching them. Following the outlined steps above helps them with remembering the content you're teaching. It makes learning more fun and effective for your students. Sum up paragraphs: Try to sum up the paragraph's entire content in the first sentence. You can think of it as a mini-intro and mini-conclusion all in one piece. The body of the paragraph that follows explains the concept in more detail and gives readers a chance to linger and absorb the information. Use parallel structure for lists and headings: Clarity is important for technical writing. Always use parallel structure when creating list items as well as headings. Parallel structure means to use the same sentence structure for each new piece of information. E.g. I wrote all the headings on this page as nouns. Each paragraph that introduces new information begins with a verb and attempts to convey the main idea of that paragraph. Parallel structure is very powerful in making your content look well structured, it can help yourself to plan out a topic clearly, and it helps your students to easier absorb the information. Use a flat TOC structure: Aim on using main headings and one additional level of sub-headings, not more. To correctly integrate with our platform, that means using <h3> headings as your main headings, and <h4> as sub-headings. Use text blocks: Each paragraph should have some visible body to it. If a text contains multiple paragraphs that consist of only one or two sentences the text may at first sight appear less professional. No need to be too strict about this, but something to keep in mind. On the other hand, also avoid making your paragraphs too blocky. Use visual aids: Using graphs, code blocks, or also fun memes and images can help to ligthen the information load on your students. Technical content can get overwhelming. You're encouraged to loosen it up and give a break to your readers' eyes by introducing visual aids. If a text section seems long and dry to yourself, it will also seems so to your students. Pop in some images to change the visual pace. Use list and paragraph headlines: Bolded words or short sentences at the beginning of a list item or a paragraph help to introduce a topic. They guide your students' eyes and assist in easier absorbing relevant information. Always try to keep them in parallel structure. Formatting \u00b6 Be consistent: Just like in programming, there are many correct ways of formatting your content. Please adhere to this style guide to allow consistency across all CodingNomads courses. And, most importantly, be consistent within your own course materials. Use bolding for new terms: Bolding should be used to introduce new terms and highlight key phrases (e.g. \"In this section, you'll learn about iteration \") Use emphasis to put focus on a word: Emphasis should be used to, well, put emphasis on a word or part of a sentence (e.g. \"There is so much to learn\") Use \"you\" instead of \"we\": Talking directly to your student makes them feel personally addressed and more engaged. (e.g. \"The project you'll be working with...\") Tone \u00b6 Be friendly, supportive, and professional: Our students should feel that they are chatting with a knowledgeable and encouraging friend who is invested in their progress and also happens to be an expert on the subject matter. Choose your words wisely: Avoid using words such as \"easy\", \"straightforward\", \"obvious\" etc. Your students are new to this topic, and what might seem easy to you, won't necessarily be easy for them. To avoid alienating students, rather use words such as \"user-friendly\". Show your personality as an author: No one likes to read or watch a sterile tutorial when learning something new and challenging. Add your personal touches--be it xkcd comics, memes, or dad jokes. Of course only if that's how you roll. Don't force it, but feel free to make it fun both for yourself while writing and recording, as well as for your students when going through the course. Most of all, allow yourself to be authentic instead of sterile. Show the instructor is also a mere mortal: It helps students to know that you also make mistakes, and that also for you some concepts were daunting at first or difficult to grasp. Show that you're supportive: Programming topics are tough and often confusing for newcomers. It can easily feel overwhelming, even after making some progress, when the door opens up wider and ever more information starts flooding in. Try to help your students by giving them a stable ground to stand on. Be supportive and encourage them to keep learning. Feel free to have some fun! We want our students to enjoy our courses as much as possible and laugh as often as possible! :)","title":"Content Creation Guidelines"},{"location":"01-content-guidelines/#content-creation-guidelines","text":"","title":"Content Creation Guidelines"},{"location":"01-content-guidelines/#structure","text":"Follow the 3-step-teaching principle: Many have recommended to use this structure, and we do too.

It is simple to read and write, introduces consistency through limiting options, and makes the content easy to re-use in other contexts. Write in Markdown rather than using a text editing program such as MS Word or Google Docs. It is also better to use Markdown than directly creating your content inside our learning platform. The latter can sometimes be a drag due to the content box window sizing and other platform-related small annoyances. It might also make the content too site-specific and difficult to transition elsewhere. We've made this mistake before, and would prefer to avoid accruing more technical debt. Here is a screencast that explains how to add your Markdown content to a resource in our platform: Headings \u00b6 As a small deviation from keeping your content as platform-agnostic as possible, you should use lower-level headings as your page's main headings: Main Headings: Use <h3> (or ### in Markdown) as your page content's main heading. Sub-Headings: Use <h4> (or #### in Markdown) as your page content's sub-headings. The course content will be integrated in our platform, and higher-level headings are reserved for course and page headings, which need to be entered in a different entry form. Links \u00b6 We want to make sure that all links open up in a new tab when clicked, to avoid students from accidentally navigating away from the course. Markdown syntax doesn't have an equivalent to HTML's target=\"_blank\" which would allow to open links in new tabs. Therefore, please use real HTML for creating links in your Markdown docs: This is <a href=\"http://your.url\" target=\"_blank\">a link</a> Code And Code Blocks \u00b6 Code snippets wrapped in single backticks as well as code blocks with triple-backticks are correctly rendered by the platform's Markdown engine. Example Markdown Rendering \u00b6 When entering your content in Markdown, it will look like that during input: The above Markdown text will correctly render in our platform like so: Text Editor Choice \u00b6 You can change your default text editor in your user profile's cogwheel drop-down Editor Preferences . Choose Marklar for the easiest Markdown editing functionality. The Marklar editor allows you to: write your content in Markdown preview with a simple button click add images through a straightforward file upload The video below shows how to change your text editor preferences.

Having a good microphone makes up for most of that, but there are also a couple of other things to consider. Read about how to improve your hardware setup for audio recording in this section. Microphone \u00b6 If you are serious about creating quality screencasts, a good microphone is essential. Please contact us if you are building a course but you don't have a quality microphone equipment, since we may be able to support you in purchasing one. Recommendation: \"Audio Technica ATR 2100 USB\" (or \"Samson Q2U\" in Europe). This is a low-price but high-quality microphone that operates over USB. It is small and simple to handle, yet dramatically increases the audio quality as compared to your built-in computer mic. Microphone Adjustments \u00b6 Distance: Aim for 2-20cm (1-8 inches) between your mouth and the microphone. Direction: Aim to speak directly into the mic, not off to the side. Gain: Turn up your gain, but avoid it going too high. Additional Equipment \u00b6 Mic Arm: Sinc you will want to have your computer in front of you for coding, a mic arm can helpto place the mic where you need it for a good recording outcome. Pop-Filter: Plosives, such as \"p\", \"t\", \"k\", can come out surprisingly loud and disturbing in a spoken audio recording. A pop filter can help to reduce these pop sounds. Headphones: In case that you like to hear your voice through the recording, during he recording, a pair of headphones will be necessary. Use in-ear headphones to avoid any sound leaking from them into your recording. Audio Foam: Using audio foam can reduce room echo. If you have a small room with fabric, such as a walk-in closet, that can also work as an uncomplicated alternative. T-Shirt: No, this is not about getting dressed! Putting a T-Shirt under your laptop while recording can significantly reduce the clicking noise that your computer keys make. Software \u00b6 Recording \u00b6 Video Length \u00b6 3-5 minutes: Keeping your videos short helps both you and your students to stay on track. Aim for 3-5 minutes per video, and definitely stay below 10 minutes. If you are explaining a complex concept that requires more time, split it up in logical chunks that are each below 10 minutes. General Info \u00b6 Which Sections Should Have a Video? \u00b6 Every Section should have at least one video. Screencasts offer students a different way to approach the material. They get exposure to a topic that is new for them, and the proof that, and how, it can be done. This makes a big difference in preparing the mind to accept new information. I like it if every new concept that's introduced is shown at least once by the instructor. (Student Quote) Video Screencasts are our online way of walking students through a concept and giving them the high-level understanding and confidence that it can be done. Course Intro & Goodbye Video \u00b6 Every course should have an intro video as well as a goodbye video. Make your students feel welcome and cared for. Introduce yourself as well as your course in the introduction video, and congratulate your students and point them to next steps in your goodbye video. Feel free to record yourself speaking. If you do so, remember to keep your background neutral. These videos can be very short (~1 min). Section Intro Videos \u00b6 Optionally you can create short section introduction videos (~1 min) that audio-visually explain what topics will be addressed in the upcoming course part. For these videos, you can use Google Sheets or PowerPoint to create simple and minimal slides that address the main points the section will be talking about. Screencasts, Slides, Or Face Recording? \u00b6 Most videos should be screencasts . You want to show your students how you code and solve challenges, and get them familiar and comfortable looking at a screen with code. Screencasts with voice narration are therefore the main type of videos you should create for your course. That said, you can always loosen it up and increase retention and enjoyment for your students. You can use slides to introduce new topics and to create recaps at the end of a section. In the intro and goodbye videos, and also sometimes in between, if you feel comfortable with that, you can record yourself talking directly to your students, giving them encouragement. Slides \u00b6 When using slides for any of your videos please use our slides template and clone your slides from it. We suggest doing this in order to keep the style consistent across multiple courses. Stick with this basic design . It'll help your students to focus on the essential information. tips \u00b6 when there's only coding, don't talk anything helpful for editing when there is no sound easy to speed it up in editing at the end quickly explain what you did avoid background noise avoid 'ahems' etc. - it feels much more professional mostly use screenshares, you can also sometimes show your face if you want to be explicit about when there are mistakes (what time etc.) - quicker to cut them out when editing undo to get back to working version when realizing that explanation doesn't go too well title of videos (saved filename) add a README for notes about editing note when there should be a screen overlay (e.g. mis-naming when talking) when recording yourself, make sure your recording setup and table is stable, so that the camera doesn't move at a minimum, use headphones and a headphone mic if you have a better microphone, please use that instead upload the finished recordings to a google photos folder for sharing stable setup, avoid background noise to make editing easier: use zoom, use pause don't talk while coding lengthily if it gets you off track, then better explain when finished name file with the title of the video add notes in doc mistake to cut and their timestamps where screen overlay is needed and what should go on there","title":"Creating Video Lessons"},{"location":"07-creating-videos/#creating-videos","text":"This document will guide you in how to create video lessons for your course.

It will make most of the below information irrelevant to you. If you feel the need to style more individually, use Bootstrap classes . Bootstrap is included in the theme we're using. Only if neither fulfills your creative urges, read on for more fine-grained styling. Objective \u00b6 We want unified and adaptable styling across all courses on the whole site. Simple : Simple elements are favored over complex ones, because they are easier to set up and maintain Reusable : Allow Bootstrap to style your page, it's already included. Maintainable : Through consistent and simple structure, we can adapt styles centrally and avoid unnecessary effort and potential misalignment Therefore, we ask you to use simple HTML (e.g. through using the Markdown editor or the WYSIWYG editor) and customize the resulting HTML only minimally, with the following custom components: Custom Components \u00b6 Additional custom components you can use when creating and editing courses. Course Overview Page Additional Styling \u00b6 The following adaptations should be used to make the course overview page styled consistently and easier readable for students. 1. Section Dividers \u00b6 To improve the visual flow in a course overview, you can add colored bars to break up the course content. Section Dividers: These can be used to sub-divide a larger section and give it a relevant sub-section heading. Create a \"Tag Resource\" on the platform, and add the following HTML code in the HTML editor: <h5 class=\"section-divider\">Section Mini-Heading</h5> Assignment Dividers: To indicate to students that the following materials require their own input, we use differently-colored dividers for a section that consist of instructions for mini-projects, quizzes, etc. You can create such a divider also using the \"Tag Resource\" and entering the following HTML code in the HTML editor: <h5 class=\"section-assignment\">Assignments</h5> 2. Section Tags \u00b6 Section tags in the \"Summary\" of each section help students stay on track and visually bundle multiple sections logically together. <h3 class=\"week week-1\">Section 1</h3> Different sections can have different styles, so add also the week-# class appropriately, e.g.: <h3 class=\"week week-2\">Section 2</h3> Page Resources Individual Styling \u00b6 The following custom style elements should be considered when creating written documentation for your course content. Headings \u00b6 In the visual editor , use editor-provided headings levels: \"Heading (large)\" option creates <h3> element \"Heading (medium)\" option creates <h4> element \"Heading (small)\" option creates <h5> element Don't apply any editor styles to your headings. We want to avoid individually bolded headings. Avoiding individual styles allows us to increase heading size, font-weight, etc. centrally through SCSS. In Markdown , use the equivalent heading levels that the visual editor uses: Top-level heading: ### Second-level heading: #### Lowest-level heading: ##### Information And Alert Boxes \u00b6 Use the Bootstrap alert box alert alert-warning for criticial information and gotchas. E.g.: \"Just read over this for now, we'll dig deeper into it in a later section.\" <div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\"> <strong>Note:</strong> Take care to avoid xyz. </div> Use alert alert-info to include additional information e.g. on external resources that can lead students further onwards. E.g.: <div class=\"alert alert-info\" role=\"alert\"> <strong>Info:</strong> The first bug was a real bug! </div> The Bootstrap alert boxes also help to visually break up a long piece of content by highlighting an important section. Code Blocks \u00b6 Wrap code snippets into triple-backticks. This works both in Markdown as well as the visual editor: ``` print(\"your code here\") ``` Note: Syntax highlighting can sometimes be broken. This might be annoying and we hope to find a fix that'll solve it site-wise. In-line Code \u00b6 In Markdown , simply wrap your in-line code into single backticks . In the visual editor , there is no button for marking a section of text as inline code. Therefore, you will need to switch to the HTML editor and wrap in-line code snippets into <code>your_code()</code> tags. Resources \u00b6 <div class=\"jumbotron resources\"> <h1>Resources</h1> </div> Paste the above HTML snippet into the HTML editor of your resource. Next, switch back to the WYSIWYG editor view and copy-paste your resource links into the body of the jumbotron. Style them as a bullet point list.
